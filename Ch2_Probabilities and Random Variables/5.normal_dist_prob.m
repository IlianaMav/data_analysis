% The length X of the steel bars produced by a machine is known to follow a
% normal distribution X âˆ¼ N(4, 0.01). In the quality check that follows 
% immediately after production, those steel bars with a length less than 
% 3.9 are rejected. What is the probability that a steel bar will be 
% rejected? Where should the limit be set in order to reject at most 1% of 
% the steel bars?
